## **TrapperAid Project** 💙 ## 

 <br/>

TrapperAid is a platform designed to centralize and streamline the TNR process through managing and coordinating all aspects of TNR. Our goal is to connect the TNR community while facilitating fundraising, scheduling, providing access to low-cost veterinary appointments, and working with local governments.<br/><br/>

### **WHY WE DO IT**

Shelters and rescues are overburdened and unable to devote adequate attention or resources to feral cats, while local trappers do not have enough resources to address the cat overpopulation problem.

CAT OVERPOPULATION PROBLEM

- 500,000 feral cats in NYC - Flatbush Cats, a nonprofit organization in Brooklyn, estimates that there are as many as half a million feral cats living in New York City.
- +3,100 colonies in NYC - Cat Stats NYC, a program from Neighborhood Cats, has a database of over 3,100 registered feral cat colonies throughout the five boroughs.
- 25% increase in surrendered animals - The Animal Care Centers of NYC, New York City’s largest animal shelter, reported a 25% increase in surrenders by owners of dogs and cats in 2022. In late July 2023, the ACC reached "critical capacity" and could only accept cat surrenders in emergency situations or if they were a safety risk.
- One female cat can produce 100 kittens in her lifetime - Per the Lynchburg Humane Society, one unfixed female cat can have more than 100 kittens in her lifetime. If half of those kittens born are females, she and her offspring can go on to have upwards of 300-400 kittens in 7 years.
